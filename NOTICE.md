# Restrictions

1. As this scaffolding is licensed under the MIT license, for closed-source projects you need to identify the project as using this scaffolding anywhere in the project that is visible and accessible to users (e.g., acknowledgements).  
  For open source projects, you need to add a link reference to this scaffolding in the README.  
  If you use a copy of a portion of the code in this scaffolding and then rewrite the used portion yourself, you still need to maintain an acknowledgement of this scaffolding.
2. We encourage you to license your project under the MPL-2.0 Open Source License, although this is not legal advice, it has a positive effect on the open source community.
3. If you encounter any failures in using this scaffolding, please actively use search engines rather than harassing the developers.
